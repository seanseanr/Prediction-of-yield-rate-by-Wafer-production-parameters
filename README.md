Wafer production parameters which do not show their roles because they are not marked with meaningful titles.
I do the following process to analyse and train the processed datas with several machine learning models.
1. The data are sotred in seperate files grouped by digit number include 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15 and ann as extsion filenames and have 4-digit_2-digit as major filenames. For example,1886_25.ann, 1886_25.6 etc. You can see the files in the directory named  sample_raw_files. I merge all the data files with MergeDataBase.ipynb and that produce the output file raw.csv.
